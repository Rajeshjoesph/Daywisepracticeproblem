A Git repository will recognize when a regular shell rm command has been executed on a file it is tracking. It will update the working directory to reflect the removal. It will not update the staging index with the removal. An additional git add command will have to be executed on the removed file paths to add the changes to the staging index. The git rm command acts a shortcut in that it will update the working directory and the staging index with the removal.
